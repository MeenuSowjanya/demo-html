    <div class="b">What this handout is about</div><br>
    <p>This handout will help you understand how paragraphs are formed,
    how to develop stronger paragraphs, and how to completely and clearly express your ideas.</p><br>
    <div class="b">How do I decide what to put in a paragraph?</div><br>
    <p>Before you can begin to determine what the composition of a particular paragraph will be,
    you must first decide on an argument and a working thesis statement for your paper. What is
    the most important idea that you are trying to convey to your reader? The information in each
   paragraph must be related to that idea. In other words, your paragraphs should remind your
   reader that there is a recurrent relationship between your thesis and the information in each paragraph.
    A working thesis functions like a seed from which your paper, and your ideas, will grow. The whole process
     is an organic one—a natural progression from a seed to a full-blown paper where there are direct, familial
     relationships between all of the ideas in the paper.</p><br>
     <div class="b">Troubleshooting paragraphs</div><br>
     <div class="c">Problem: the paragraph has no topic sentence</div><br>
     <p>Imagine each paragraph as a sandwich. The real content of the sandwich—the meat or other filling—is in the middle.
     It includes all the evidence you need to make the point. But it gets kind of messy to eat a sandwich without any bread.
      Your readers don’t know what to do with all the evidence you’ve given them. So, the top slice of bread (the first sentence
      of the paragraph) explains the topic (or controlling idea) of the paragraph. And, the bottom slice (the last sentence of the
      paragraph) tells the reader how the paragraph relates to the broader argument. In the original and revised paragraphs below,
       notice how a topic sentence expressing the controlling idea tells the reader the point of all the evidence.</p>
